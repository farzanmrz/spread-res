It’s difficult to trace the origins of closing stores on Sunday, but one early and short-lived attempt at forcing the Sabbath on people in the 1800s was motivated by the Protestant ideal that people should spend Sunday focusing on spiritual activities.  By the mid-1800s, when the Sunday closing law was made, there was not a lot of pressure from that standpoint, but the church had begun to advocate for Sunday closing laws as a way of counteracting the negative effects of industrialization on the day of rest.  Even after that shift, closing stores on Sunday was not always possible, since the religious Sunday was not always chosen for observance.  And as industrialization accelerated and mechanization made it possible to operate stores on Sunday, the law was not enforced as much as people liked.  The day of rest was also being violated by stores that stayed open all day on Sunday, so closing stores on Sundays became an effort to protect the Sabbath for all citizens.']],\n",

Palatalization refers to a shift from a sound in the front of the mouth to a sound in the back of the mouth. These types of shifts are actually quite common, as a lot of languages change their sound systems over time. Take the English words for “old” and “cold”. In Old English (also called Anglo-Saxon, or sometimes “OE”), these were pronounced as [a:dl] and [k:ld]. In Middle English (or “ME”), they were pronounced with a “d” that’s like a “t” (like in the “t” in the word “toy”), and [k]. But in Modern English, we now pronounce the “d” more like “t”, and the [k] has palatalized to a [t].

I think my answer is “yes” and “no.”  You may be thinking of “Time Dilation” or “Warp Drive”, but it’s not what I’m thinking of.   What I’m thinking of is the way that our imagination works.\\n\\nImagine you had a thin sheet of flexible plastic which could be pulled out from a roll to become a long tube, about 100m long.  We call this a “wormhole”, as in, it’s a flexible wormhole.  If you were floating in space, and grabbed one end of it and held it, then the other end would stretch to the ground, into the ground and back out again.  If you stood on the ground, you could then pull it and have it lift you up into the air.  The question is, could the Earth rotate under the “wormhole” while the person holding it was “in the air”?\\n\\nThe answer is, no.  The “wormhole” analogy is a bit strange, so let me explain it more carefully.\\n\\nI think when you are floating above the ground, you are also moving around it.  But in the same way that you can hold one end of the wormhole while floating, the Earth is also moving around you.  So you might wonder how it could “rotate” while you are also moving around it.\\n\\nThis is a situation of accelerating motion.  A spaceship, say, accelerates around the Earth so that it is moving at a speed which is near the speed of light.  As it flies past, we say it moves “faster than light” and we call this “tachyonic motion” or “tachyons” for short.  Tachyons are things that accelerate faster than light, and as they pass by, objects may seem to move or “rotate” as they pass, even though the objects themselves are not moving.\\n\\nI hope this answer has helped to clarify how we can still see the Earth rotating even if it is also accelerating in the other direction.  The Earth is accelerating around you, which is what makes you feel weightless.  This is why it’s called “Weightlessness”.']],\n",

If you believe that you are experiencing a real physical or mental problem that would be alleviated by downsizing, then you can let go of some possessions and find ways to minimize hoarding.

In the aftermath of the trial, public opinion was very negatively polarized towards alcohol, and people were eager to pursue measures that would restrict or completely prohibit the sale of alcohol. As a result, Prohibition was brought in.\\n\\n'],\n",

During Prohibition, there was a rise in bootlegging and illegal manufacturing and sales of alcohol, which led to massive loss of life. Bootleggers, when found, would be shot on sight, without a trial. This led to some of the largest human rights violations in the United States. Over 5,000 people were killed by the law enforcement officials and gangs that were trying to enforce Prohibition. Hundreds of thousands of people were arrested and placed in police custody. In order to control the human rights abuses during the enforcement of Prohibition, the Volstead Act was passed in 1924, which further punished and marginalized those who were convicted of bootlegging.

The first is to put a robot in the car, which is kind of like a remote-control helicopter.  The robot would have a video camera, some artificial intelligence, and some sensors.  When you are driving, you would be able to see out the window and steer and accelerate and brake with a joystick or other controls, so it’s like you are driving, but you aren’t.  You’d control the robot, and the robot would control the car.  If you wanted to be super safe, you could build an extra sensor in the car that would only drive in the safest conditions, and when there were hazards, or if the car sensed the driver wasn’t doing what they should, then the robot would actually take over control of the car and drive it instead.  This is the safer way, but it would also be kind of slow because the robot would just be doing the exact same thing that you would have done, and if you messed up, the robot would also mess up.\\n\\nThe other way is to give your car a super powerful computer, with artificial intelligence, and a pretty fast internet connection, and let it drive itself.  This car would also have some sensors, but it wouldn’t really need them, because it would always have access to so much more information than you do.  When you are driving, you would choose where you want to go, and your car would use all of its data to come up with the best route and way to get there.  The computer would make all the decisions about how to handle unexpected events and road conditions, and would do the braking and steering and everything.  It’s kind of like having a flying car that is in control of everything, and you just decide where you want to go.  Most people use cars like this, because they’re pretty good and most of the time you don’t really want to do all of that work and risking making a mistake.']],\n",

For a small part of that mechanism, there are two endogenous receptors for dopamine that work by binding to the neurotransmitter and transporting it elsewhere in the body.

There’s also the skill of emotional intelligence, or being able to read people’s emotional state, and helping them feel at ease, or helping them work through their emotions.

But if you’re the consumer, you’ll want to be sure that you’re buying LiPo batteries from a manufacturer that actually tests its product for safety. Another thing to consider is that since the chemical reaction in LiPo batteries causes it to decompose to lithium metal, and a little of that metal can cause fires, you’ll also want to take care not to discharge it down to a very low voltage or to handle it in conditions that would cause it to heat up a lot.\\n\\n'],\n",

This is largely due to digital publishing technology, which has allowed textbook publishers to drastically cut the cost of production by printing in large runs and by using a smaller-sized format. The more the information can be printed, the lower the cost per book. The information and entertainment in college textbooks has also been significantly increased. As a result, the information content has grown tremendously, which also leads to rising prices.\\n\\nAs technology has made it easier to do research, more and more students are choosing to major in fields that use a lot of research. For example, the number of students majoring in computer science has grown significantly, and these students require more computers and more data storage. Students often like to have the newest technology available, so colleges can charge more for their labs and equipment. Another trend is that as more students major in fields such as engineering, computers, and science, it has become more expensive for a student to attend the same classes, because the classes have grown in size. \\n\\nOne of the most significant increases in costs has come from \"soft money\".\\n\\n'],\n",

It is about a stranger who arrives in a small town, and begins to interfere in a love triangle between the town’s prostitute, her psychopath husband, and her new boyfriend. The strangers name is “Harmonica”, played by Charles Bronson. The film is unique in that it has no real main character or hero.

We want to add at least two extra spoonfuls of batter to the smaller pan, as the amount you add to a pan is going to expand while baking and soak up the liquids you put in it.

Now, we want to mix everything really well to make sure it’s all mixed evenly.  We’ll mix for a full three minutes, we’ll let the mixer run at high speed for two minutes, and then we’ll run it at medium speed for one minute.  Then we’ll stop the mixer, take the whisk out, and take the bowl of batter off the mixer.  Next, we’ll use the same whisk to beat the batter in the bowl, so that the air bubbles go away and it’s completely mixed.  We don’t want any clumps.  Once the bubbles have been beaten away, we’ll pour in the batter into two smaller pans.  In the larger pan, we’ll pour in three cups of batter, and in the smaller pan we’ll pour in two cups.

For re-entry to the house, stay on the perimeter of the scene, and avoid touching any fire or smoke. If the fire is not under control, leave the scene, and notify emergency services (911, in the US) as quickly as possible. If an extinguisher is available, do not throw water onto the fire. Instead, douse it in an area where it can’t spread, or use a foam extinguisher to smother the fire. Otherwise, extinguishers should be held with both hands, and aimed at the base of the fire.

First you’ll need to heat the water in a pan over a stove or fire, but not enough that it will start boiling.  Once the water starts boiling, slowly add the wax into the water.  As soon as the wax is in the water, you want to stir it to create a thicker layer of wax, so it doesn’t dissolve into the water, but a little bit will melt.  That’s important to avoid wax in the bottom of your candles and extra wax in your fingers.

More importantly, this argument is immoral since it requires punishing people who have not committed any crime, which is by definition immoral.  Moreover, if we were to ban guns outright, gun crime would still exist.  For example, since there are numerous ways to circumvent anti-gun laws, criminals would just use other weapons (e.g. knives, clubs, and bombs) in place of guns.  Furthermore, since anti-gun laws simply won’t stop criminals from having guns, and won’t stop most crimes, it seems reasonable to assume that they will actually increase the crime rate, since criminals will have even fewer constraints in committing their crimes.

The painter Vincent Van Gogh was an important artist in the late 1800s, who focused on what we call “Expressionist” art.  He believed that the artist should reflect their feelings in their art, rather than trying to describe them.  That means that there will often be very high emotion or intensity in his paintings.  And an interesting result of this is that some people don’t really like Van Gogh’s paintings.  For instance, when you Google his painting The Starry Night, you’ll see lots of people sharing photos of it on social media saying things like “I hate this painting” and “It’s gross.”  Other people find the high emotion of the painting intriguing or refreshing, and enjoy it.
